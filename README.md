AgriDatasets.jl is an open-science Julia package designed to provide seamless access to a curated collection of 71 agricultural, agronomic, soil, and animal science datasets. It serves as a centralized data hub for academic instruction, statistical modeling, and applied agricultural research in Julia.

The package standardizes historical and scientific datasets sourced from multiple R packages (e.g., agridat, ALUES, AgroR, gpk, aqp, GLMsData) and open-access repositories like Zenodo, presenting them in clean, consistent DataFrames.jl structures while preserving the underlying dataset values.

Features
71 Curated Datasets: Covers soil science, pest control, crop yields, forestry, livestock production, and experimental designs (Latin squares, split-plot, uniformity trials).
Standardized Naming: All datasets are renamed using consistent, descriptive English snake_case identifiers.
Fast & Simple Access: A functional API (list_datasets, load_dataset, dataset_info) integrated directly with DataFrames.jl and CSV.jl.
Comprehensive Metadata & Licensing: Includes a built-in metadata catalog with source attribution and licensing information.
Installation
AgriDatasets.jl can be installed using the Julia package manager.

Using Pkg mode
Press ] in the Julia REPL to enter Pkg mode:

pkg> add AgriDatasets
Using the Pkg API
Alternatively, you can install the package directly from the Julia REPL:

using Pkg
Pkg.add("AgriDatasets")
Then load the package:

using AgriDatasets

# 1. List all available datasets
available = list_datasets()

# 2. Inspect metadata for a specific dataset
info = dataset_info("arabica_soil")

# 3. Load a dataset as a DataFrame
df = load_dataset("arabica_soil")

# Preview the first few rows
first(df, 5)
Package API
The package exports three primary functions:

list_datasets(): Returns a Vector{String} containing the names of all available datasets in the package.

load_dataset(name::AbstractString): Loads the specified dataset by name and returns it as a DataFrame.

dataset_info(name::AbstractString): Retrieves specific metadata (description, source, variables) for a given dataset. Calling dataset_info() without arguments returns the full metadata catalog.
